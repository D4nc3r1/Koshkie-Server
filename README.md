# Introduction
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/ahmedemad3965/Koshkie-Server.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/ahmedemad3965/Koshkie-Server)

This is a RESTful **API** for a system called **Koshkie**.
Koshkie is a food, groceries and medicines delivery app.
The **API** is designed using **Django** and **Postgres** database.
The Project is completely done and the full docs will be written soon.
The Project is **open-source** and not used commercially be any means.
The **API** contains 4 sections (or apps) **users**, **driver**, **shops** and **orders**.
Each section is stored in a different directory and has its own modules and urls.
The **API** is fully tested with 100% Code coverage with automated **tests** in a separate folder in each app.
The **docker** and **docker-compose** images configuration files are stored with in the project so that you can use it and test it from anywhere with no problems.
You can freely use, edit and learn from this project.
This project is very large, it contains over 10,000+ lines of code, it's also difficult because it contains many advanced features and principals of **django**, **django-rest-framework** and web back-end programming in general.

# Full Documentation to be written soon!
